Myself Prem Shandilya, a student at IIT Madras pursuing a BS in Electronic Systems. I have a deep passion for designing and UI/UX, crafting intuitive and visually appealing user experiences. Beyond design, I enjoy exploring new technologies, problem-solving, and working on innovative projects that bridge hardware and software. Iâ€™m also interested in entrepreneurship, product development, and building digital experiences that make a real-world impact.
